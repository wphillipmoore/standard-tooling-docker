# Architecture

## Build Strategy

All images are built from Dockerfile templates using a two-stage process:

1. `generate.sh` expands `Dockerfile.template` files by replacing
   `# @include` directives with the contents of shared fragments from
   `docker/common/`.
2. `build.sh` calls `generate.sh` then runs `docker build` for every
   language and version combination.

├── python/Dockerfile.template

├── go/Dockerfile.template
├── java/Dockerfile.template
└── rust/Dockerfile.template
```

### Templating

Each `Dockerfile.template` contains standard Dockerfile instructions plus
`# @include common/<fragment>.dockerfile` directives. `generate.sh`
replaces each directive with the full contents of the referenced fragment,
producing a final `Dockerfile` in the same directory.

This eliminates duplication — shared tool installations (GitHub CLI,
Node.js, markdownlint, validation tools) are maintained once in
`docker/common/` and included by every template that needs them.

### Version management

All shared tool versions are pinned via `ARG` directives in the common
fragments. A version bump is a one-line change in one file, applied to
all images automatically at build time.

## Common Tooling Layer

Every language image includes the following shared fragments:

- **`path-defaults.dockerfile`** — Sets PATH for `uv tool install`
  entry points across GitHub Actions and local contexts.
- **`node-markdownlint.dockerfile`** — Node.js via NodeSource apt repo
  and markdownlint-cli via npm.
- **`github-cli.dockerfile`** — GitHub CLI via the official apt repo.
- **`validation-tools.dockerfile`** — Architecture-aware binary
  installs of shellcheck, shfmt, actionlint, git-cliff, and hadolint.
  Uses `TARGETARCH` (injected by Docker Buildx) to select the correct
  binary for amd64 or arm64.
- **`python-support.dockerfile`** — Minimal Python plus yamllint and
  uv, used by non-Python images.

Python-based images (`dev-python`, `dev-base`) install yamllint and uv
directly via pip rather than the `python-support` fragment.

The `dev-base` image includes all common fragments plus documentation
tooling (MkDocs Material, mike, semgrep). It is the fallback image for
repos with no detected language.

## Design Principles

**Thin images** — Each image provides the language runtime, package
manager, and common tooling layer. Project-specific dependencies (from
lockfiles like `Gemfile.lock`, `uv.lock`, `go.sum`) are installed at
container startup by the consuming repository's test script.

**No repo-specific logic** — Images are general-purpose dev containers.
Any repository using the supported language can use them.

**No duplication** — Shared tooling is maintained in common fragments.
Adding a tool to all images means editing one fragment file.

## Multi-Architecture Support

All images are published as multi-architecture manifests supporting
**amd64** and **arm64**. Binary tool downloads in `validation-tools.dockerfile`
use `TARGETARCH` (injected by Docker Buildx) to select the correct
platform artifact.

Local builds via `docker/build.sh` build for the host's native
architecture only (for speed). The CI pipeline builds both platforms
using QEMU emulation on the GitHub Actions runner.

## Publishing

Images are published as multi-arch manifests to GitHub Container Registry
via the reusable `cd-docker-publish.yml` workflow, parameterized by an
`image-prefix` input that determines the naming convention:

- **`dev-` images** (`ghcr.io/wphillipmoore/dev-{language}:{version}`) —
  built on every push to `develop` and rebuilt nightly via `ops.yml` to
  pick up base-image security patches.
- **`prod-` images** (`ghcr.io/wphillipmoore/prod-{language}:{version}`) —
  built on push to `main`, after the release workflow generates a
  changelog, git tag, and GitHub release.

The publish pipeline for each prefix:

1. Builds a candidate tag for both platforms (amd64 + arm64)
2. Scans each platform independently with Trivy (SARIF upload)
3. Attests build provenance (SLSA via GitHub attestations)
4. Promotes the candidate to the final tag via `docker buildx imagetools create`
5. Verifies digest preservation between candidate and final

### Image namespace

Image URLs use the **user namespace** (`ghcr.io/wphillipmoore/...`), not
a repo-specific namespace. This means image paths are stable across
repository migrations — they do not change when the publishing repository
changes.

Image naming: `ghcr.io/wphillipmoore/{prefix}-{language}:{version}` where
`{prefix}` is `dev` or `prod`.

### Release workflow

Pushes to `main` trigger the `cd-release.yml` reusable workflow, which
generates a changelog (via git-cliff), creates a git tag and GitHub
release, and opens a version-bump PR back to `develop`. The docker
publish job runs after the release completes.

### Nightly rebuilds

The `ops.yml` workflow runs daily at 06:15 UTC and rebuilds all `dev-`
images. This ensures development images stay current with upstream
security patches without waiting for a code change to trigger a build.

### Authentication

The workflow authenticates with `GITHUB_TOKEN` using `packages: write`
permission. No personal access token or additional secret is needed.

### GHCR package access grants

Each `dev-*` and `prod-*` package on GHCR must explicitly grant this
repository write access. The packages were originally created by the
`standard-tooling` repository, so that repo has implicit write access.
This repo does not, unless manually configured.

Per-package setup (one-time, for each of `dev-base`, `dev-python`,
`dev-java`, `dev-go`, `dev-ruby`, `dev-rust`, and the corresponding
`prod-` packages):

1. Navigate to the package settings page on GHCR.
2. Under **Manage Actions access**, click **Add Repository**.
3. Select `standard-tooling-docker`.
4. Set role to **Write**.

## Consumption

Images are consumed via `st-docker-run` and `st-docker-test` in
[standard-tooling](https://github.com/wphillipmoore/standard-tooling).
`st-docker-run` runs arbitrary commands inside the matching container;
`st-docker-test` auto-detects the project language and runs the test
suite. Consuming repos can override the image with the `DOCKER_DEV_IMAGE`
environment variable.
